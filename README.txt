A Monthly Calendar widget, highly configurable,
enable you to select a post type and field for the date to be used.

The Widget can be used for:

* Display post in a calendar view according to publish date or according to a custom field storing different date.
* Display a custom post type in a calendar view according to custom field as date or using the post publish date.
* Display pages the same way.


Here are some ideas for using SOGO Calendar Widget Plugin:

* Display events in a widget
* Display Trainings in a widget
* Display online meetings in a widget

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Does it support RTL

Yes

2.can I put more then 1 widget in one page

yes,  as many as you like

3. how does it work?

you need to create a custom field first that will hold the date for the event (we are not using the post date
as it will not be publish before the date occur) therefor, we use a new custom field (meta field) that will store the
date for the event.
once you have the custom field you need to enter its name i the widget area.
